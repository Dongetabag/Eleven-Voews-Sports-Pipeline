================================================================================

[00:00] If you're still using AI in the
browser, you're doing it the slow way.
[00:03] You see each of these apps has a terminal
version and they make me 10 times
[00:06] faster.
[00:06] I'm getting so much work done and the AI
companies are kind of quiet about this.
[00:10] They're marketing these
tools to developers for code,
[00:13] but here's what they're not telling you.
[00:14] You can use them for everything and
it's way better than their apps.
[00:18] Writing research projects, working
in the terminal is a superpower.
[00:21] I'm about to show you why I'm literally
writing this video with these tools
[00:24] right now and most people have no idea
this is a thing, but I'm telling you,
[00:27] once you see AI in the terminal,
you're never going back to the browser,
[00:31] so get your copy ready. We're going
to my favorite place, the terminal,
[00:34] but hold up before we go there. I
know what you're thinking, Chuck.
[00:37] I use AI just fine.
[00:39] Do you tell me if this sounds like you
because this is how I used to use ai.
[00:42] You're in the browser app, you're
asking questions, research mode.
[00:45] You're diving deep into a project,
can't even see your scroll bar anymore,
[00:48] and this is your fifth chat because
chat GBT lost its context or it's mine.
[00:52] You also created a few more chats with
Claude and Gemini to make sure chat GBT
[00:55] wasn't lying and yeah,
[00:56] you tried to copy and paste some stuff
into your notes app to keep track That
[00:59] never works. At this point, your
project is a mess. Spread over 20 chats,
[01:03] two deep research sessions and scattered
notes. There's a better way to do this.
[01:07] Hear me out, attend the terminal.
[01:08] Now we're not going to waste any time
we're diving straight into the terminal
[01:11] and I know you probably
have some questions.
[01:13] Put those in your pocket for a
second and we'll address those,
[01:15] but I first just want to
show you what it looks like.
[01:17] I want you to try it so you
can know it's not really scary.
[01:19] The terminal's a fun place and we're
going to play with Gemini CLI first. Why?
[01:23] Because it has a very generous
free tier. That's right.
[01:26] You heard it free and I'll
show you claw code in a second.
[01:28] That's my favorite by far Overpowered,
[01:30] but they share a lot of the same
concepts. Let's just get you going.
[01:33] We can install it with one command
now go ahead and launch a terminal.
[01:36] It doesn't really matter where you
launch it. Mac, windows, Linux,
[01:38] all these terminal apps work
everywhere. Great for me.
[01:41] I'm going to use Windows with WSL
or the Windows subsystem for Linux.
[01:45] If you have no idea what that is, it's
totally fine. I got a video right here,
[01:48] so I'll launch my Ubuntu terminal,
zoom in so you guys can see,
[01:51] and we'll copy and paste this command
installing Google Gemini CLI. Ready, set,
[01:55] go Coffee break. While that goes,
[01:58] never checked our coffee and
if you run into a scary issue,
[02:01] run it with pseudo just like
this and if you're on Mac,
[02:04] you can also use Brew Brew. Install
Gemini dash CLI. Now it's installed.
[02:08] Before we launch it, we're going
to make a new directory, M-K-D-I-R.
[02:11] Then we'll call it coffee project just
like this and let's jump in there.
[02:15] CV Coffee Project. Now
we can launch Gemini.
[02:18] You'll see why I did this here in a
second. Type in Gemini. One word. Ready,
[02:21] set, go. We're here now first,
[02:25] isn't that logo just awesome? I love
the terminal. It's so nostalgic.
[02:28] Now first thing you'll do is get
logged in with your Google account.
[02:31] Everyone has a Google account and yes,
this can be a free regular Gmail account.
[02:35] This can open your browser. Sign in
and I'm logged in. Now don't be scared.
[02:39] Go ahead,
[02:39] ask it a question like how
do I make the best cup of
[02:44] coffee in the world?
[02:46] I love the little messages that
give us herding digital cats.
[02:48] It's doing a Google search
right now, pretty sick,
[02:51] crafting the guide and then it
responds just like we're used to.
[02:54] That wasn't so bad was it? But notice
some superpowered things. First of all,
[02:58] we got Gemini two five Pro, the
latest and greatest model. Also,
[03:01] the browser doesn't show
you this 99% context left.
[03:05] Every chat you have with
AI has a context window.
[03:07] The browser hides it from you
and the terminal does not. Also,
[03:10] your browser can't do this watch.
[03:12] I really want you to find the best way
to make coffee research the top 10 sites,
[03:16] only reputable sources,
[03:17] and then compile the results into a
document named Best Coffee method.md and
[03:21] then create me a blog plan, just an
outline. I'll do the writing ready,
[03:25] set and go. Alright, now
it's asking us a question.
[03:27] Do you want me to write a file for you?
Do you want me to create a file for you?
[03:31] Yeah, dude, go for it. This thing
can do everything a browser can do,
[03:35] but it has a superpower. It
can access your computer,
[03:37] it can read and write files like
I'm not copying and pasting this.
[03:41] It's doing it for me. I mean look, it
actually made files on our computer.
[03:45] There they are. Best Coffee Method coffee
blog. Think about that for a second.
[03:49] It can access your obsidian vault,
[03:51] all your notes because those are just
files sitting there on your hard drive.
[03:53] It can run Bash and Python scripts.
[03:55] It can do mostly everything because we
broke it out of the browser. Anyways,
[03:59] back to the terminal. If we type in
forward slash tools and hit enter,
[04:03] you can see all that Gemini's allowed
to do. You can even add more tools,
[04:06] but this feature right here is what
made me switch from the browser to the
[04:09] terminal.
[04:10] Watch this type in forward
slash and it just like that go,
[04:14] what it's doing right now
is something powerful.
[04:16] It's creating a Gemini MD file and in
the process it analyzed our project,
[04:21] read our folder, read our
files and yes, go ahead buddy.
[04:25] Create that file for me.
[04:26] What it just did there was
create instructions for itself,
[04:29] context for what we're working
on. Let's take a look at it.
[04:32] Cat gemini.md and while we didn't
do much in this project, it knows,
[04:36] it knows what's going on and
every time you launch Gemini,
[04:39] it's going to load that file as
its context like let's test it.
[04:42] So we still have our Gemini session open.
[04:44] I'll open up another Gemini
session in that same directory.
[04:47] This is a new conversation, fresh
context, a hundred percent left notice.
[04:50] It's using our new gemini.md
file and I'll tell it this.
[04:53] Write the intro for blog post
one and the coffee series.
[04:58] No more context, just that it should
know exactly what I'm talking about.
[05:01] Look at that. Yep, go ahead buddy.
I didn't give it any context,
[05:04] it just knew this is a new
chat session and as I work,
[05:07] I can just ask Gemini to update that file
with my thoughts, research decisions.
[05:11] We made the progress of
our project and look,
[05:13] it added a summary to what we were
working on to our gemini.md file.
[05:16] I can close all this. Start up a new
session. It picks up where we left off.
[05:20] No re-explaining the context, no starting
over, no more 20 scattered chats.
[05:25] We just had this one file that helps
keep us organized. Everything you need,
[05:28] you're never paralyzed again. Now
when I saw this, I'm like, this is it.
[05:31] I finally have control over my
context, my files, my projects.
[05:35] They're not stuck in some
browser chat session anymore.
[05:37] They're right here sitting on
my hard drive mine, my precious.
[05:43] Now I'm literally using the gemini.md
file right now for this project.
[05:46] This is a small example.
Let me show you a big one.
[05:48] This is the gemini.md file for
this video. It tracks everything.
[05:51] It describes how I create project
status, major decisions I made,
[05:56] even other documents should
look at. Yeah, it can do that.
[05:59] I'll launch a whole new Gemini session
in this project and I'll ask you for
[06:02] where we're at in the
project. Are you seeing this?
[06:07] This has completely changed the way I
create or do anything now and I don't just
[06:10] use Gemini. It's not even close to
the best one. Let's look at CLO code,
[06:14] my daily driver. This one's so crazy. Now,
[06:18] real quick time for a coffee break and
a bit of a PSA thanks to our sponsor,
[06:22] twin Gate.
[06:22] Now I'm teaching you and millions of
other people how to use AI and the
[06:26] terminal,
[06:26] which will also give AI access to your
computer and all your files and access to
[06:30] do pretty much anything. This
is cool, but also really scary.
[06:33] Especially scary if they're a remote
employee because not only does your remote
[06:37] employee or just remote person that you
give access to your lab or your internal
[06:41] network have access to everything over
a traditional VPN if that's what you're
[06:45] still using. I'm talking your
servers, file servers, nas,
[06:48] because that's normally
how traditional VPNs work.
[06:50] If someone has remote
access to the network,
[06:53] their computer has access to
everything in the network,
[06:56] which means their AI may have access
to everything in your network.
[06:59] This is insane and it's why traditional
VPNs are dead or at least should be.
[07:03] You should be using Twin Gate instead.
[07:04] Twin Gate is all about
zero trust network access,
[07:06] meaning they zero trust people connecting
to your network and you should zero
[07:10] trust them too. With Twin Gate,
[07:11] your employee is given access to
nothing unless you explicitly give it.
[07:15] So Beatrice here, she's on the marketing
team and given access to the nas,
[07:20] but only the NAS and nothing else and
definitely not access to the super secret
[07:24] file server where we keep all our
coffee recipes. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:27] And Twin Gate takes
this to the next level.
[07:29] This is one of my favorite features
right here. Trusted profiles.
[07:32] You can make it to where not just any
device can connect to your network and
[07:35] it'll do checks to see like, Hey, are
they running Android? Sorry buddy,
[07:38] you're out of here because
iPhones are clearly better.
[07:41] Everyone agrees or if they have Windows
we can make sure a hard drive encryption
[07:44] is required and they have screen lock
and a firewall and antivirus and their OS
[07:49] is up to date and we can block Windows 10.
[07:51] All these checks will happen
before they're allowed to
connect to your network.
[07:54] This is crazy because it's also free for
up to five users. If you're a business,
[07:58] it's a no-brainer, but for like
a home laber, you seeing this,
[08:02] you can geek out with some
enterprise security. It's just fun.
[08:05] And speaking of enterprises, if I
create a trusted Windows profile,
[08:09] I can connect this to my
CrowdStrike, Intune, Jamf one,
[08:13] whatever EDR or EDMI have and have that
tell me if that device is secure or if
[08:18] it meets my standards. Now, me and my
team, we use Twin Gate every single day.
[08:21] If you're still using traditional
VPN, you're crazy, try out Twin Gate.
[08:25] You can set it up in about five
minutes and it seriously is the best,
[08:27] most secure way to access your home
lab or your business network remotely.
[08:31] So go check it out, twin gate.com/network
chuck or check the link below,
[08:35] thanks to Twin Gate for sponsoring
this video and this channel.
[08:37] They help make my videos possible. I
love my partnership with them. Anyways,
[08:41] coffee break over back to the
video. Now I use cloud code,
[08:44] which is Claude in the terminal
for pretty much everything.
[08:46] It's my default and here's why. It has
a feature that changes the game agents.
[08:50] Look at this. I have seven
agents performing tasks
right now in one terminal.
[08:54] Actually there's 10, and listen,
[08:56] that's just one of the seven features
it has that keeps me glued to the
[08:58] terminal. Now, cloud code is not
free, but I do have good news.
[09:01] If you already pay for Claude Pro,
which starts at like 20 bucks a month,
[09:05] you can log into the terminal with
this subscription and use it. So yeah,
[09:08] you don't have to use
API keys. And by the way,
[09:10] if you can only pay for
one AI subscription,
[09:12] cloud Pro is the one I would choose,
[09:14] especially for the last feature
I'm going to show you. Now,
[09:16] let's get it installed with one command.
[09:18] We'll copy and paste this bad boy right
here, NPM install. You get it now?
[09:21] I already have it installed.
[09:22] It should tell me that or ask me to do
pseudo it yelled at me again, I'm sorry,
[09:26] and then we'll launch Claude
very similarly to Gemini.
[09:28] Just type in Claude and
your directory. That's it.
[09:32] It'll prompt you to get logged in and
then ask permission to access this folder.
[09:35] Yes, of course. No. Again, don't
be afraid. Ask Claude a question.
[09:39] I need to find a NAS for my house.
Here's my budget. What I want to do,
[09:44] create a report for me
and just like Jim and I,
[09:46] it does have some fun little messages
for us. It'll search the web.
[09:50] It's got this nice TUI terminal
user interface. Oh, whoops.
[09:54] Our thinking is off. I can press
tab to turn on thinking mode.
[09:57] Now we're thinking and
notice it is security first.
[10:00] It does ask you permission to
do most things and that's good.
[10:02] We can get past that here in a moment
if you're feeling dangerous. I am,
[10:06] so we respond similar to Gemini. It
can also have a context file too.
[10:09] If I run that same command slash knit,
[10:12] it will create what's
called a Claude MD file,
[10:15] noticing a trend here and
it's doing the same thing,
[10:17] looking through our project,
[10:18] trying to figure out what's what
and creating a context file.
[10:21] And also similar to Gemini, we can do
something like forward slash context,
[10:25] which is so crazy. We can see
exactly how many tokens we've used,
[10:28] how much we have left and exactly what's
using it. But what's funny with Claude,
[10:33] that doesn't really matter too much as
long as you know how to use their most
[10:36] powerful feature agents, let's
make a Claude agent right now.
[10:40] It's really simple. We'll do
four slash agents just like this.
[10:44] We'll get a terminal menu and let's
create a home lab research expert and I'll
[10:48] just tell it that. So create a new agent.
[10:50] Notice it'll ask us where
do you want to make it?
[10:52] Because you can have agents that are tied
to just this project we're working on
[10:55] or personal agents that are tied to
everything. You can always call them.
[10:59] We'll do just this project.
We'll use Claude to make it.
[11:01] We can tell it what we want it to be.
[11:03] It's going to paste this in
here and let it go to work.
[11:05] Notice you can give it access
to tools or restrict access.
[11:09] We'll give it everything. Choose
our model sonnets, great auto color.
[11:13] There's our agent.
[11:14] Press enter to save and we'll hit escape
to get out of that interface and we
[11:18] just made our first agent home lab
guru, but what's the point of that?
[11:21] I kind of feel like we can just ask
Claude to do research for us because we
[11:24] literally just did that.
You're right, but watch this.
[11:28] I'm going to do a four slash context
once more so we can get our baseline.
[11:31] We've used 85,000 tokens.
[11:32] I'll give you this prompt and
I'm calling it home lab agents.
[11:35] It'll figure it out. I'll have a
create a document and I'll say,
[11:37] make sure you reference
the research we made.
[11:41] I can just do an at symbol and look at
the documents in our directory is the NAS
[11:45] rec folder. There we go. Watch. It's
going to use the home lab guru agent.
[11:50] There it is. There's our agent
researching for us right now.
[11:53] Now here's why this is amazing, actually
kind of insane. So Claude was like,
[11:57] cool, I've got a task but it's not for me.
[11:59] I'm going to delegate this task to one
of my employees or one of my coworkers,
[12:03] and this is another Claude instance.
It's like a guy sitting over there.
[12:06] He's like, Hey buddy, are you
busy? Here's some work to do.
[12:09] He's giving him a fresh set of
instructions and get this a fresh context
[12:14] window. You saw just now we have
200,000 tokens in our context window.
[12:18] We use 42% of it. This
guy, he's got a fresh 200.
[12:21] That means the conversation we're having
right now, me and the main CLA guy,
[12:25] it's protected. It
doesn't get too bloated.
[12:27] I can give tasks to other sub-agents and
never have to leave this conversation.
[12:32] Claude just delegated this task to a new
agent. He's got a fresh pot of coffee,
[12:35] he's ready to go.
[12:37] He just walked into work and you can
create a ton of different agents for
[12:40] different purposes.
[12:41] I use them all the time to protect my
context and avoid any kind of weird bias.
[12:44] For example, here's my YouTube
outline for this video.
[12:47] I'll normally be working with Claude
on an outline like this and often the
[12:50] context window can get pretty big.
[12:52] Like this is where I'm at right now
and let's say at this point I want a
[12:54] comprehensive review of my outline.
I have a brutal critic agent.
[12:58] I can just deploy. Hey, let's have, I'll
just do at and call him. There he is,
[13:02] agent, brutal critic, review my outline.
And by the way, this is a fun one.
[13:06] It's designed to just completely roast
me according to the framework I have and
[13:10] the scripting goals and it just deploys
it. My conversation is still sane,
[13:14] but I have a new energized employee,
just got a new sub coffee in hand,
[13:18] fresh eyes ready to go. Look at him,
[13:20] go and you can run multiple agents like
I showed you at the beginning of this
[13:23] segment. Let's go check in our home lab
agent. Actually, he's been kind of busy.
[13:26] Oh, he's still going. We're going to have
the best home lab ever and by the way,
[13:29] we can hit control O to see what
he's doing. Oh no, I interrupted him.
[13:36] I interrupted. Sorry. Keep
going. Don't mind me. Actually,
[13:39] let's open up a new window,
jump into our project,
[13:41] which we still have coffee project.
It's okay, it'll figure it out.
[13:46] Launch Claude in there.
He's got his Claude MD file.
[13:48] He knows what's going on
and let's run this prompt.
[13:50] We'll launch our home lab agent to
research the best proximate servers.
[13:54] At the same time,
[13:55] do a general agent that'll just search
for the best pizza place in Dallas,
[13:57] Texas,
[13:58] and then another home lab agent that'll
find the best graphics card for gaming
[14:01] right now and then put it all together
in a comprehensive report. Let's go.
[14:05] Now that's doing its stuff right now,
deploying new employees over here.
[14:09] I've got the home lab guru working,
finding the best network equipment.
[14:12] I feel so powerful right now. This is so
fun. Yeah, they're the three agents go.
[14:16] Of course we got to give it permission
to search the web and stuff a lot.
[14:21] Actually, I'll show you how to get
past that here in a moment. Actually,
[14:23] I'll show you right now. I'm
going to actually interrupt them.
[14:26] I'm going to hit control C to get
out of there. Control C twice.
[14:30] We can run this switch and actually
I'll do Claude dash R so I can resume a
[14:33] previous conversation. Yes, you
can do that. And then I'll do dash,
[14:37] dash dangerously, dash skip permissions.
[14:41] This is cloud without training
wheels. Ready, set, go.
[14:43] We can choose that previous chat we
had. Let's do this one here. Yes,
[14:46] I interrupted you. I'm sorry. Go ahead
and do it again. And notice right here,
[14:50] bypass permissions on go.
Now we're cooking, man.
[14:55] Look at this. Three employees,
fresh cups of coffee just going.
[15:00] I told you the terminal was
awesome. Let's get crazier.
[15:02] I'll create another tab because no one
can stop us to our project Launch cloud
[15:06] in dangerous mode. And what
do you see? We have Claude,
[15:09] use Gemini for research. Yes,
[15:12] because we can run Gemini and Claude
and all these terminal tools in headless
[15:16] mode, meaning you don't jump into a
TUI, you just run them with one command.
[15:20] It's like Gemini dash P and then
here's your prompt. Find pizza.
[15:24] We can just create an agent that
does that. Let's make it happen.
[15:27] Create a new agent. I'll give it a
basic prompt. You are a research expert.
[15:33] You will use Gemini in headless mode to
[15:37] research. Use it like
this. That should do it.
[15:41] Let's check in our home lab
guru. Yeah, he finished up.
[15:44] It's looking back at our home lab guru.
He used 40,000 tokens just himself,
[15:48] fresh employee. Let's check our
context for this conversation.
[15:51] We only used 4,000 more tokens for that.
It was 85, now we're at 88. Alright,
[15:55] now let's find the best AI
terminal videos on YouTube.
[16:00] Use the Gemini research agent
[16:06] and look at that. It's
using Gemini to search.
[16:08] We're having an AI use in AI right now.
[16:10] There's the prompt to want to hit control
O. Let's check on our multi-agent,
[16:13] see how they're doing. They're still
working man. Alright, it finished up.
[16:18] Our agent used Gemini to
find the top 10 videos,
[16:20] but this next feature is tied with how
awesome agents is and I'm embarrassed to
[16:24] say I just found this out while
making this video. Now, cloud code,
[16:28] it was built for coders. It's in
the name, but I hacked it kind of.
[16:31] Cloud code has a feature
called output styles.
[16:34] Look at this word slash output style.
[16:37] We got a few defaults in here and these
essentially control the system prompt
[16:41] for claw code, how it's going to
respond to you. The persona it has,
[16:45] the default is code and that's what
we're using, but we can change that.
[16:48] Let's create a new one.
So I'll go back here,
[16:51] type an output style again and do output
style new. It's actually an agent.
[16:54] I didn't know that. Let's just be simple.
[16:56] You are a home lab expert
designed to help me
[17:01] create the best home
lab possible. That's it.
[17:06] Now we can get a lot crazier than that,
but you get the idea and that's it.
[17:08] If I type in output style, there it is,
[17:11] I can adopt that right now or when
I back out and I jump back in.
[17:15] I think it should adopt that
style by default. Yes it does.
[17:19] You can create output styles that are
tied to just your project or as a whole,
[17:23] whatever project you jump into, you
can switch to those output styles.
[17:26] I'm using the output style
right now to make this video.
[17:28] You want to see it script writing, output
style and this is what it looks like.
[17:31] It's pretty intense. Optimize
for what I do. Now, honestly,
[17:34] this entire video could be about clo.
[17:36] There are so many features like you can
do shift tab to cycle between modes.
[17:39] One of my favorites is planning mode,
hit shift tab. There were plan mode on
[17:45] this will put a very well thought out
plan together and then you approve it and
[17:48] then it just does it like there
it is and no keep planning or yes,
[17:52] let's keep doing it. And there are
so many things I can't dive into 'em.
[17:54] They have prompts, hooks,
custom status lines.
[17:57] You can paste images into your
terminal. But here's the thing,
[18:00] I don't just use Claude code, I use
Gemini. I use Claude code and I use Codex,
[18:04] which is Chad Biz's terminal
tool all at the same time.
[18:07] Let me show you how Gemini,
Claude Code, Chad, BTS, codex.
[18:11] I'm using all three right now to work
on this video script. How two steps.
[18:15] First, as long as I open up Claude,
Gemini and Codex in the same directory,
[18:18] they're all using the same
context. It's the same project.
[18:21] Let's do that right now. Claude Gemini,
[18:26] if I spell it right and Codex,
[18:28] the second thing I do is I make sure
my context files are all synced up.
[18:32] They all say the same thing. So
Gemini, do MD, claw MD and Agents md,
[18:37] which is what Codex uses and they're
trying to make it a standard.
[18:40] They're all the same.
[18:41] And I usually have a terminal open for
each one while I'm working on a script or
[18:44] any kind of project. Watch this,
[18:45] I'll tell Claude to write a hook
for this video authority angle.
[18:48] Write it to Authority Hook md.
[18:54] I'll have Jim and I write a
hook on a discovery angle,
[18:56] write it to Discovery hook.md
and then I'll have Codex
[19:01] review it. And that's normally
what I do. I find chat.
[19:06] BTS very good at analyzing
things from a high view.
[19:10] Gemini and Claude are very good at the
work, the deep work and look at it go.
[19:13] They're all using the same
context, different roles.
[19:16] I mean have three different ais working
on the same thing at the same time.
[19:19] No copying and pasting. They
can see each other's work.
[19:22] They're working in the same directory.
That's awesome. And it's done.
[19:26] Looks like Claude won this
one. Good job, Claude.
[19:28] Now are you seeing what's happening here?
This is the craziest part about this.
[19:32] Everything I'm doing talking with
these three different ais on a project,
[19:36] it's not tied in a browser,
it's not tied in a gui.
[19:39] It's just this folder right
here on my hard drive.
[19:42] I can copy and paste that folder
anywhere. All the work, all the decisions,
[19:46] all the context. It's mine.
And that's the difference.
[19:49] Nothing annoys me more than when
Chad GBT tries to fence me in.
[19:52] Give me that vendor Lockin. So I
can't leave. No, I reject that.
[19:56] I own my context. If a new
greater, better AI comes out,
[20:00] I'm ready for it because all my
stuff is right here on my hard drive.
[20:03] I will use all ai, I'll use the
best ai. No one could stop me.
[20:07] So I got a little excited there and
that's what I want you to take away here.
[20:10] Leading the browser,
going to your terminal,
[20:12] puts you back in control and
it gives you better features.
[20:16] But now I want to get real practical.
[20:17] I want to show you exactly
how I run a project like this.
[20:21] How I keep things in
sync, how I keep my claw,
[20:23] Gemini and agent's files in sync and
work on a daily basis using a system like
[20:28] this. I'm going to refill my
coffee. I'll see you there. Okay.
[20:31] This video was made with this process.
[20:33] First thing I want to show you
is how things are synced up.
[20:36] Specifically my Claude file, my
Gemini file, and my agent's file,
[20:39] which is Codex. It's an
agent. That's all it is.
[20:41] So if I get back to my terminal here where
I was showing you earlier when we had
[20:44] our hooks developed, Claude made
one, made one and Codex critiqued it.
[20:48] I rely on Claude to run my agent.
That will close out everything.
[20:52] So I'll just normally do this when
I'm done for the day. I'll go, Hey,
[20:56] let's close this out,
[20:58] run and I'll mention my
agent script session closer.
[21:03] Lemme show you what that looks like.
[21:04] This is one of those agents
I keep as a personal agent.
[21:07] I use it for many projects and
these agents are just files.
[21:11] They're files inside an agent's
folder. I'll cat that file here,
[21:15] script session closer and here
it is. It does a lot of stuff,
[21:18] but some of the key things it does,
[21:19] and actually while I'm
talking with you about this,
[21:20] I'm going to go and run the agent.
We did some stuff, didn't we?
[21:23] I'll run the agent, but first it'll
gather everything we talked about,
[21:26] everything we did and do
a comprehensive summary.
[21:28] It'll then update a session summary file
that's specific to just updating what
[21:33] are some things that were
done in the past sessions.
[21:35] It'll see if any core project
files need to be updated.
[21:38] And if I'm talking with Claude,
it'll update every context.
[21:40] File Claude Gemini agents and then
this is probably my favorite part.
[21:44] I commit my project to a GitHub repo.
[21:47] So normally you would use Git for
code for writing and deploying code.
[21:52] I treat my scripts and pretty much every
project I work on in my life like code,
[21:57] we commit that change,
[21:58] give a reason for that change so I can
see a history of what I did and why I did
[22:03] it. Maybe something breaks, I can go
back to that change and reinstate it.
[22:07] That's the power of using
GitHub with all your ideas.
[22:11] Now this is killer for me because
I'm really bad at documentation.
[22:15] I'm really bad at keeping track of things,
[22:17] but now I have this help
me keep track of things.
[22:19] So when I'm really tired at the end of
the day and I've been working on a video
[22:22] and my mind is fried, I'm like, okay,
tell you what, I'm done. Close this out.
[22:27] It will look through all this stuff.
It will figure out where I'm at,
[22:31] end the project,
[22:32] end the day where I need to be and then
I can start fresh the next day and be
[22:36] like, Hey, where are we at? What are we
working on? They can tell me, Hey Chuck,
[22:40] you finished the script. It's time to
record. We made these three decisions,
[22:43] go for it. That's it.
[22:47] This is the tool I've been looking for.
[22:49] The syncing is probably
my favorite part. No, no,
[22:52] actually this thing's my
favorite part. How it roasts me.
[22:56] So I don't only use these AI
terminal tools to help me create.
[22:58] I use them to critique me and make
me better. So here are my critics.
[23:02] These guys are so stinking mean and
I designed them to be they're agents.
[23:07] I get the brutal critic.
I told 'em to be mean.
[23:09] So I had an issue where my AI
was being way too agreeable.
[23:12] I'd write something and be like, oh Chuck,
best thing you ever wrote. I'm like,
[23:16] ah, you're gaslighting me. Stop it.
I wanted something to be super mean.
[23:20] I want it to be hard to please so that
when it did tell me I did a good job,
[23:23] I knew it. It was good and
that's what this thing does.
[23:26] So actually I'm curious if my
script right now is any good.
[23:30] I actually have not used it yet on this,
which I normally don't do. It's bad.
[23:34] Let's see. I'll say use the
brutal critic to absolutely
[23:39] roast and verify my stuff
is good and this script,
[23:44] I'll just reference my script again,
[23:45] everything's a file local
here on my file system.
[23:48] I mean you can just move so quickly and
nimbly when you have a system like this
[23:53] and the agent's going to go, it's
going to do its thing. And again,
[23:55] what I love about this is while I've
been talking with this AI for a minute,
[23:58] right? We've been going
back and forth doing things.
[24:00] If I asked that session to review me,
[24:02] it would have a ton of bias coming into
that based on what we've been talking
[24:05] about. I don't want that. I want a fresh
cup of coffee credit coming in, going,
[24:10] here's what I know network Chuck needs
to have and I'm going to roast his
[24:14] current script on what he's
doing. That's what I need.
[24:16] Notice it was really quick
editor free stream on that.
[24:20] I have inside its instructions to read
some framework documents I have that
[24:23] describe how I create and describe what
my thing is, who my audience is. Again,
[24:28] I don't copy and paste. I got context
already here. You can reference that.
[24:32] I love this so much. It's my favorite
thing. I had to make a video about this.
[24:35] I wouldn't stop telling my wife
about it and she was going crazy.
[24:38] Whenever he talks to me, it just
goes in one ear and out the other.
[24:42] I tell everyone about this.
[24:43] I'm actually really scared about
what it's going to say. Oh no. Okay,
[24:49] let's see what it said, said when I fix
it, it'll be good. What did it tell me?
[24:53] Oh, it's an 8.2. It's not
bad. Now I forgot I did this.
[24:58] The brutal critic has three personalities
or three people that come in and roast
[25:03] it from different angles. I forgot
I did that. It's insane. Okay,
[25:06] I don't like this. I'm not sure
I agree with this. We'll see.
[25:09] It says segment five is a feature
dump nine features, zero depth,
[25:12] five to 8% retention drop, which
means you'll stop watching.
[25:15] Let's prove it wrong. Segment
five five's coming up.
[25:18] We're currently in segment four. Jump
there if you want to. I don't care.
[25:21] Tell me if it's bad. It's
actually really cool I hope,
[25:24] but seriously doing stuff like
this saves me hours. Now also,
[25:27] I want you to know this.
It's not writing for me.
[25:30] I'm doing the writing
because I like to keep that.
[25:32] I think that's important now with
ai, but I do have AI roast me,
[25:36] help me stay on track. I get distracted.
[25:38] I might make some really bad creative
decisions that aren't in line with what
[25:41] we're trying to do. Now,
[25:43] the point I want to hit home
is that I made this for me.
[25:46] This is my own personal
software, exactly my use case.
[25:50] What can you build for you that's just
for you and your niche and whatever
[25:53] you're trying to make happen and
this is just one tool I've made.
[25:57] Look at the other stuff I've done.
[25:58] That crazy project I showed you in the
beginning was running like seven agents.
[26:02] This is a custom built project just with
claw code and I'm going to use it right
[26:06] after I record this. It's
going to go through every file,
[26:09] it's going to transcribe it, read
it, and give my editors notes.
[26:13] They need to be able to
edit this video like,
[26:15] Hey Chuck repeated himself 17 times in
the fourth video and it's a disaster.
[26:20] Ignore that one. It
will do that. Seriously,
[26:22] the tools I create are so powerful for me.
[26:24] I wake up every day feeling like I have
superpowers. I want this for you. Now,
[26:29] speaking of superpowers,
let's talk about segment five.
[26:32] There's a tool that's
actually open source.
[26:34] Now you can use any model you want with
this open source alternative and it
[26:38] might be the best tool of all
of them. I'm still testing it.
[26:41] You also get grok free,
[26:42] which is pretty sick and a really powerful
part of this is you can log in with
[26:45] your cloud Pro subscription and use it
like cloud code. Let's play with it.
[26:49] It's called open code. We can
install it with one command.
[26:52] I'll have all these commands below
installing. That was quick and that's it.
[26:56] If I can just launch open code, just
type it in like this. That does it. Oh,
[27:00] let me do a source because
it edits to my bash RC file.
[27:04] You might have to do
this too. Source bash rc.
[27:08] Now let's try it. You can open and close
your terminal and do the same thing.
[27:12] Oh, we're here. This is open code. A
nice two E terminal user interface.
[27:16] Couple of things real quick.
[27:17] They launched this straight
into grok code Fast one.
[27:20] They have a deal with grok AI that allows
you to use this for free for a while,
[27:24] so same story. Hey, GR code's
helping us even knows like,
[27:29] Hey, can I help you with your
coffee project? No mask stuff.
[27:34] So it read the document and it
can do all the stuff. Okay, cool.
[27:37] I'm going to exit out. We can use
local models. This is the killer part.
[27:40] I don't think any other tool does this,
[27:42] but we have to edit a file talking
about nano and I think it's inside
[27:46] config Open code. Yeah,
[27:49] that's the directory and then I
think the file has to be open code
[27:53] JSON C. I'll paste this
in here. I'm going to use,
[27:56] let's do llama 3.2. I think that's
what have installed. We'll find out.
[28:01] I'll save that. Let see llama
list, see what my models are.
[28:06] Do I have 3.2? I'll
pull it down if I don't,
[28:10] and then when I launch OPA code again
with that config in place, oh wait,
[28:13] what did I break? Lemme fix that
file real quick. There we go.
[28:17] I should be able to go forward
slash model and change to LAMA 3.2.
[28:23] Hey, cool Lama works. If I back out,
[28:25] I can log into cloud with this command,
[28:28] open code auth login.
[28:32] I can choose Aaro with my cloud
pro and I'll launch this browser,
[28:39] paste this code in there
and now log into cloud code.
[28:42] I just launch open code now
and switch models to cloud
[28:47] sonet 4.5 and we can pick up our
wheel left off because again,
[28:50] all our files are local. It
doesn't matter what tool we use.
[28:52] It's all ours right here. I can switch
models midway. Let's go back to gro.
[28:58] Cool, what's our next step?
Cool. While it's doing that,
[29:02] I can do new session.
This is a new session.
[29:05] There's models to Claude.
I can do sessions,
[29:10] see all the sessions I have.
Why do I have so many? Oh,
[29:13] these are my past sessions.
[29:14] We can also share these sessions
slash share and watch this.
[29:19] This is so crazy. I think
I was going to do it. Oh,
[29:22] the URL is copied in my clipboard,
so I can go to my browser,
[29:24] paste that URL in and I can, I mean,
look at that. That's awesome. Wait,
[29:29] is it live? You can share your session
with people. That's pretty neat.
[29:34] Okay, we can do timeline.
[29:37] We can jump back in time and restore.
[29:40] I guess if we like how far we've come
in our conversation, we just go back.
[29:43] I want that in real life.
That's awesome. We can also,
[29:46] if I jump out of there
and do open code help,
[29:51] they've got agents. You can
start a headless server.
[29:54] You can attach to headless servers.
Export your session is JSO data.
[29:58] I mean this tool is pretty cool and the
fact that you can log in and use your
[30:02] cloud pro subscription,
[30:04] that's next level because otherwise
you're putting in an API key and you're
[30:07] paying per use and that's a whole
nightmare. I'd rather pay up front.
[30:10] What's fun is I've been following these
guys on Twitter before they started
[30:13] making this code, open code, this
guy Dax, these guys are killing it.
[30:16] So how do you feel about your browser
based gooey AI now? Pretty bad, right?
[30:21] Kind of feels like hammer and
chisel or chisel and hammer.
[30:23] I never know how to say it because
now you can control your context.
[30:25] Break out of that browser,
[30:27] that chat window and don't let
the terminal scare you. I mean,
[30:30] I know it's kind of intimidating if you're
not used to working in the terminal.
[30:33] If you can get past that,
this tool is for everyone.
[30:35] Everyone should be using
this. Make everyone use this.
[30:38] I'm going to make my kids use
this. I dunno about my wife.
[30:41] I'm not sure if she's
going to do it. Seriously,
[30:42] nothing is stopping you from trying
this right now. Jim and I see a lie.
[30:45] That's free open code.
[30:46] You can run local models if you're
worried about that and while cloud code is
[30:49] paid, it's overpowered, like you saw all
those features. I use that every day.
[30:54] Dude, just you got to try it. Dip
your toe in the water, it's fine.
[30:57] It's awesome.
[30:58] You will feel like you have a superpower
and build whatever you want. Now,
[31:01] do you want to go even
deeper? You can add tools,
[31:03] MCP servers to any of these
terminal environments.
[31:06] I made a video about doing MCP servers
here. You can add it to all these.
[31:11] Check it out. That's the video. I'll
catch you guys next time. Oh, by the way,
[31:14] have you hacked the
YouTube algorithm today?
[31:16] Let's make sure you do hit that
light button. Subscribe, comment.
[31:20] I gave a doc notification bell. You
got to hack YouTube today, ethically,
[31:23] of course. Oh,
[31:23] and also let me know which is your
favorite terminal AI tool or if you even
[31:27] care. I'm curious, do you care about
this? Because I care a lot, obviously.
[31:32] Tell me below. Yeah,
that's it for real. Hey,
[31:36] you made it to the end of the
video. This portion of the video,
[31:39] I like to reserve for praying
for you. You are a person. Well,
[31:43] actually I can't say that
anymore. It might be ai.
[31:45] I don't know if you're a person,
this is for you. You have a life,
[31:48] you've got goals, you've got
things you're trying to do.
[31:50] You're watching this video because
you want to learn something new.
[31:53] I want to pray for that. I
want to pray for your life.
[31:55] This may not be your thing. Totally
cool. You can click off, that's fine.
[31:58] So I put it at the end of the
video, but if you stay, thank you.
[32:01] The reason I'm doing this is because
I do believe in the power of prayer.
[32:04] The reason I do anything on this channel
to help people or all the things I'm
[32:08] doing is because of Jesus. He saved me.
[32:10] He's empowered me to do everything I'm
doing and I don't know what your beliefs
[32:13] are on that regardless, I just
want to pray for you. That's it.
[32:17] So let's do it real quick. God,
[32:18] I thank you for the person
watching this video right now.
[32:20] I thank you that they are excited
about tech and their lives and wanting
[32:25] to do something cool. Otherwise,
why would they be here?
[32:29] I pray that you would just fill them
with joy about the future that you remove
[32:33] any anxiety that you give them peace
that you would bless their families and
[32:38] let their families be healthy and strong
and if there's anything going on in
[32:41] their lives right now
that are really hard,
[32:43] that's just really hard to get through
[32:46] divorce or just any kind of sin that's
really bogging them down, Jesus,
[32:51] I pray deliverance over them right now
that you give them a path forward and
[32:56] just let them be excited
about their career.
[32:58] I pray you go before them and
make their path straight, God,
[33:01] that you would create opportunities
for them and that they would take these
[33:05] skills they're learning and do something
really fun and cool with them that will
[33:09] provide for their families and give them
a bright future. I pray this over them,
[33:12] God,
[33:13] and ultimately I pray that all of this
will lead them to maybe one day just
[33:18] knowing you more deeply,
knowing you better,
[33:22] and knowing that having a relationship
with you is the greatest gift,
[33:26] the greatest thing,
[33:26] that there's nothing greater you can
attain apart from knowing you. Jesus,
[33:31] I thank you for this person and I just
thank you for this community and for
[33:35] letting us do this cool stuff. It's
a privilege. In Jesus name I pray.
[33:40] Amen. Alright, thanks guys.
I'll see you in the next one.

FULL TRANSCRIPT (no timestamps):
================================================================================

If you're still using AI in the
browser, you're doing it the slow way. You see each of these apps has a terminal
version and they make me 10 times faster. I'm getting so much work done and the AI
companies are kind of quiet about this. They're marketing these
tools to developers for code, but here's what they're not telling you. You can use them for everything and
it's way better than their apps. Writing research projects, working
in the terminal is a superpower. I'm about to show you why I'm literally
writing this video with these tools right now and most people have no idea
this is a thing, but I'm telling you, once you see AI in the terminal,
you're never going back to the browser, so get your copy ready. We're going
to my favorite place, the terminal, but hold up before we go there. I
know what you're thinking, Chuck. I use AI just fine. Do you tell me if this sounds like you
because this is how I used to use ai. You're in the browser app, you're
asking questions, research mode. You're diving deep into a project,
can't even see your scroll bar anymore, and this is your fifth chat because
chat GBT lost its context or it's mine. You also created a few more chats with
Claude and Gemini to make sure chat GBT wasn't lying and yeah, you tried to copy and paste some stuff
into your notes app to keep track That never works. At this point, your
project is a mess. Spread over 20 chats, two deep research sessions and scattered
notes. There's a better way to do this. Hear me out, attend the terminal. Now we're not going to waste any time
we're diving straight into the terminal and I know you probably
have some questions. Put those in your pocket for a
second and we'll address those, but I first just want to
show you what it looks like. I want you to try it so you
can know it's not really scary. The terminal's a fun place and we're
going to play with Gemini CLI first. Why? Because it has a very generous
free tier. That's right. You heard it free and I'll
show you claw code in a second. That's my favorite by far Overpowered, but they share a lot of the same
concepts. Let's just get you going. We can install it with one command
now go ahead and launch a terminal. It doesn't really matter where you
launch it. Mac, windows, Linux, all these terminal apps work
everywhere. Great for me. I'm going to use Windows with WSL
or the Windows subsystem for Linux. If you have no idea what that is, it's
totally fine. I got a video right here, so I'll launch my Ubuntu terminal,
zoom in so you guys can see, and we'll copy and paste this command
installing Google Gemini CLI. Ready, set, go Coffee break. While that goes, never checked our coffee and
if you run into a scary issue, run it with pseudo just like
this and if you're on Mac, you can also use Brew Brew. Install
Gemini dash CLI. Now it's installed. Before we launch it, we're going
to make a new directory, M-K-D-I-R. Then we'll call it coffee project just
like this and let's jump in there. CV Coffee Project. Now
we can launch Gemini. You'll see why I did this here in a
second. Type in Gemini. One word. Ready, set, go. We're here now first, isn't that logo just awesome? I love
the terminal. It's so nostalgic. Now first thing you'll do is get
logged in with your Google account. Everyone has a Google account and yes,
this can be a free regular Gmail account. This can open your browser. Sign in
and I'm logged in. Now don't be scared. Go ahead, ask it a question like how
do I make the best cup of coffee in the world? I love the little messages that
give us herding digital cats. It's doing a Google search
right now, pretty sick, crafting the guide and then it
responds just like we're used to. That wasn't so bad was it? But notice
some superpowered things. First of all, we got Gemini two five Pro, the
latest and greatest model. Also, the browser doesn't show
you this 99% context left. Every chat you have with
AI has a context window. The browser hides it from you
and the terminal does not. Also, your browser can't do this watch. I really want you to find the best way
to make coffee research the top 10 sites, only reputable sources, and then compile the results into a
document named Best Coffee method.md and then create me a blog plan, just an
outline. I'll do the writing ready, set and go. Alright, now
it's asking us a question. Do you want me to write a file for you?
Do you want me to create a file for you? Yeah, dude, go for it. This thing
can do everything a browser can do, but it has a superpower. It
can access your computer, it can read and write files like
I'm not copying and pasting this. It's doing it for me. I mean look, it
actually made files on our computer. There they are. Best Coffee Method coffee
blog. Think about that for a second. It can access your obsidian vault, all your notes because those are just
files sitting there on your hard drive. It can run Bash and Python scripts. It can do mostly everything because we
broke it out of the browser. Anyways, back to the terminal. If we type in
forward slash tools and hit enter, you can see all that Gemini's allowed
to do. You can even add more tools, but this feature right here is what
made me switch from the browser to the terminal. Watch this type in forward
slash and it just like that go, what it's doing right now
is something powerful. It's creating a Gemini MD file and in
the process it analyzed our project, read our folder, read our
files and yes, go ahead buddy. Create that file for me. What it just did there was
create instructions for itself, context for what we're working
on. Let's take a look at it. Cat gemini.md and while we didn't
do much in this project, it knows, it knows what's going on and
every time you launch Gemini, it's going to load that file as
its context like let's test it. So we still have our Gemini session open. I'll open up another Gemini
session in that same directory. This is a new conversation, fresh
context, a hundred percent left notice. It's using our new gemini.md
file and I'll tell it this. Write the intro for blog post
one and the coffee series. No more context, just that it should
know exactly what I'm talking about. Look at that. Yep, go ahead buddy.
I didn't give it any context, it just knew this is a new
chat session and as I work, I can just ask Gemini to update that file
with my thoughts, research decisions. We made the progress of
our project and look, it added a summary to what we were
working on to our gemini.md file. I can close all this. Start up a new
session. It picks up where we left off. No re-explaining the context, no starting
over, no more 20 scattered chats. We just had this one file that helps
keep us organized. Everything you need, you're never paralyzed again. Now
when I saw this, I'm like, this is it. I finally have control over my
context, my files, my projects. They're not stuck in some
browser chat session anymore. They're right here sitting on
my hard drive mine, my precious. Now I'm literally using the gemini.md
file right now for this project. This is a small example.
Let me show you a big one. This is the gemini.md file for
this video. It tracks everything. It describes how I create project
status, major decisions I made, even other documents should
look at. Yeah, it can do that. I'll launch a whole new Gemini session
in this project and I'll ask you for where we're at in the
project. Are you seeing this? This has completely changed the way I
create or do anything now and I don't just use Gemini. It's not even close to
the best one. Let's look at CLO code, my daily driver. This one's so crazy. Now, real quick time for a coffee break and
a bit of a PSA thanks to our sponsor, twin Gate. Now I'm teaching you and millions of
other people how to use AI and the terminal, which will also give AI access to your
computer and all your files and access to do pretty much anything. This
is cool, but also really scary. Especially scary if they're a remote
employee because not only does your remote employee or just remote person that you
give access to your lab or your internal network have access to everything over
a traditional VPN if that's what you're still using. I'm talking your
servers, file servers, nas, because that's normally
how traditional VPNs work. If someone has remote
access to the network, their computer has access to
everything in the network, which means their AI may have access
to everything in your network. This is insane and it's why traditional
VPNs are dead or at least should be. You should be using Twin Gate instead. Twin Gate is all about
zero trust network access, meaning they zero trust people connecting
to your network and you should zero trust them too. With Twin Gate, your employee is given access to
nothing unless you explicitly give it. So Beatrice here, she's on the marketing
team and given access to the nas, but only the NAS and nothing else and
definitely not access to the super secret file server where we keep all our
coffee recipes. No, no, no, no, no, no. And Twin Gate takes
this to the next level. This is one of my favorite features
right here. Trusted profiles. You can make it to where not just any
device can connect to your network and it'll do checks to see like, Hey, are
they running Android? Sorry buddy, you're out of here because
iPhones are clearly better. Everyone agrees or if they have Windows
we can make sure a hard drive encryption is required and they have screen lock
and a firewall and antivirus and their OS is up to date and we can block Windows 10. All these checks will happen
before they're allowed to
connect to your network. This is crazy because it's also free for
up to five users. If you're a business, it's a no-brainer, but for like
a home laber, you seeing this, you can geek out with some
enterprise security. It's just fun. And speaking of enterprises, if I
create a trusted Windows profile, I can connect this to my
CrowdStrike, Intune, Jamf one, whatever EDR or EDMI have and have that
tell me if that device is secure or if it meets my standards. Now, me and my
team, we use Twin Gate every single day. If you're still using traditional
VPN, you're crazy, try out Twin Gate. You can set it up in about five
minutes and it seriously is the best, most secure way to access your home
lab or your business network remotely. So go check it out, twin gate.com/network
chuck or check the link below, thanks to Twin Gate for sponsoring
this video and this channel. They help make my videos possible. I
love my partnership with them. Anyways, coffee break over back to the
video. Now I use cloud code, which is Claude in the terminal
for pretty much everything. It's my default and here's why. It has
a feature that changes the game agents. Look at this. I have seven
agents performing tasks
right now in one terminal. Actually there's 10, and listen, that's just one of the seven features
it has that keeps me glued to the terminal. Now, cloud code is not
free, but I do have good news. If you already pay for Claude Pro,
which starts at like 20 bucks a month, you can log into the terminal with
this subscription and use it. So yeah, you don't have to use
API keys. And by the way, if you can only pay for
one AI subscription, cloud Pro is the one I would choose, especially for the last feature
I'm going to show you. Now, let's get it installed with one command. We'll copy and paste this bad boy right
here, NPM install. You get it now? I already have it installed. It should tell me that or ask me to do
pseudo it yelled at me again, I'm sorry, and then we'll launch Claude
very similarly to Gemini. Just type in Claude and
your directory. That's it. It'll prompt you to get logged in and
then ask permission to access this folder. Yes, of course. No. Again, don't
be afraid. Ask Claude a question. I need to find a NAS for my house.
Here's my budget. What I want to do, create a report for me
and just like Jim and I, it does have some fun little messages
for us. It'll search the web. It's got this nice TUI terminal
user interface. Oh, whoops. Our thinking is off. I can press
tab to turn on thinking mode. Now we're thinking and
notice it is security first. It does ask you permission to
do most things and that's good. We can get past that here in a moment
if you're feeling dangerous. I am, so we respond similar to Gemini. It
can also have a context file too. If I run that same command slash knit, it will create what's
called a Claude MD file, noticing a trend here and
it's doing the same thing, looking through our project, trying to figure out what's what
and creating a context file. And also similar to Gemini, we can do
something like forward slash context, which is so crazy. We can see
exactly how many tokens we've used, how much we have left and exactly what's
using it. But what's funny with Claude, that doesn't really matter too much as
long as you know how to use their most powerful feature agents, let's
make a Claude agent right now. It's really simple. We'll do
four slash agents just like this. We'll get a terminal menu and let's
create a home lab research expert and I'll just tell it that. So create a new agent. Notice it'll ask us where
do you want to make it? Because you can have agents that are tied
to just this project we're working on or personal agents that are tied to
everything. You can always call them. We'll do just this project.
We'll use Claude to make it. We can tell it what we want it to be. It's going to paste this in
here and let it go to work. Notice you can give it access
to tools or restrict access. We'll give it everything. Choose
our model sonnets, great auto color. There's our agent. Press enter to save and we'll hit escape
to get out of that interface and we just made our first agent home lab
guru, but what's the point of that? I kind of feel like we can just ask
Claude to do research for us because we literally just did that.
You're right, but watch this. I'm going to do a four slash context
once more so we can get our baseline. We've used 85,000 tokens. I'll give you this prompt and
I'm calling it home lab agents. It'll figure it out. I'll have a
create a document and I'll say, make sure you reference
the research we made. I can just do an at symbol and look at
the documents in our directory is the NAS rec folder. There we go. Watch. It's
going to use the home lab guru agent. There it is. There's our agent
researching for us right now. Now here's why this is amazing, actually
kind of insane. So Claude was like, cool, I've got a task but it's not for me. I'm going to delegate this task to one
of my employees or one of my coworkers, and this is another Claude instance.
It's like a guy sitting over there. He's like, Hey buddy, are you
busy? Here's some work to do. He's giving him a fresh set of
instructions and get this a fresh context window. You saw just now we have
200,000 tokens in our context window. We use 42% of it. This
guy, he's got a fresh 200. That means the conversation we're having
right now, me and the main CLA guy, it's protected. It
doesn't get too bloated. I can give tasks to other sub-agents and
never have to leave this conversation. Claude just delegated this task to a new
agent. He's got a fresh pot of coffee, he's ready to go. He just walked into work and you can
create a ton of different agents for different purposes. I use them all the time to protect my
context and avoid any kind of weird bias. For example, here's my YouTube
outline for this video. I'll normally be working with Claude
on an outline like this and often the context window can get pretty big. Like this is where I'm at right now
and let's say at this point I want a comprehensive review of my outline.
I have a brutal critic agent. I can just deploy. Hey, let's have, I'll
just do at and call him. There he is, agent, brutal critic, review my outline.
And by the way, this is a fun one. It's designed to just completely roast
me according to the framework I have and the scripting goals and it just deploys
it. My conversation is still sane, but I have a new energized employee,
just got a new sub coffee in hand, fresh eyes ready to go. Look at him, go and you can run multiple agents like
I showed you at the beginning of this segment. Let's go check in our home lab
agent. Actually, he's been kind of busy. Oh, he's still going. We're going to have
the best home lab ever and by the way, we can hit control O to see what
he's doing. Oh no, I interrupted him. I interrupted. Sorry. Keep
going. Don't mind me. Actually, let's open up a new window,
jump into our project, which we still have coffee project.
It's okay, it'll figure it out. Launch Claude in there.
He's got his Claude MD file. He knows what's going on
and let's run this prompt. We'll launch our home lab agent to
research the best proximate servers. At the same time, do a general agent that'll just search
for the best pizza place in Dallas, Texas, and then another home lab agent that'll
find the best graphics card for gaming right now and then put it all together
in a comprehensive report. Let's go. Now that's doing its stuff right now,
deploying new employees over here. I've got the home lab guru working,
finding the best network equipment. I feel so powerful right now. This is so
fun. Yeah, they're the three agents go. Of course we got to give it permission
to search the web and stuff a lot. Actually, I'll show you how to get
past that here in a moment. Actually, I'll show you right now. I'm
going to actually interrupt them. I'm going to hit control C to get
out of there. Control C twice. We can run this switch and actually
I'll do Claude dash R so I can resume a previous conversation. Yes, you
can do that. And then I'll do dash, dash dangerously, dash skip permissions. This is cloud without training
wheels. Ready, set, go. We can choose that previous chat we
had. Let's do this one here. Yes, I interrupted you. I'm sorry. Go ahead
and do it again. And notice right here, bypass permissions on go.
Now we're cooking, man. Look at this. Three employees,
fresh cups of coffee just going. I told you the terminal was
awesome. Let's get crazier. I'll create another tab because no one
can stop us to our project Launch cloud in dangerous mode. And what
do you see? We have Claude, use Gemini for research. Yes, because we can run Gemini and Claude
and all these terminal tools in headless mode, meaning you don't jump into a
TUI, you just run them with one command. It's like Gemini dash P and then
here's your prompt. Find pizza. We can just create an agent that
does that. Let's make it happen. Create a new agent. I'll give it a
basic prompt. You are a research expert. You will use Gemini in headless mode to research. Use it like
this. That should do it. Let's check in our home lab
guru. Yeah, he finished up. It's looking back at our home lab guru.
He used 40,000 tokens just himself, fresh employee. Let's check our
context for this conversation. We only used 4,000 more tokens for that.
It was 85, now we're at 88. Alright, now let's find the best AI
terminal videos on YouTube. Use the Gemini research agent and look at that. It's
using Gemini to search. We're having an AI use in AI right now. There's the prompt to want to hit control
O. Let's check on our multi-agent, see how they're doing. They're still
working man. Alright, it finished up. Our agent used Gemini to
find the top 10 videos, but this next feature is tied with how
awesome agents is and I'm embarrassed to say I just found this out while
making this video. Now, cloud code, it was built for coders. It's in
the name, but I hacked it kind of. Cloud code has a feature
called output styles. Look at this word slash output style. We got a few defaults in here and these
essentially control the system prompt for claw code, how it's going to
respond to you. The persona it has, the default is code and that's what
we're using, but we can change that. Let's create a new one.
So I'll go back here, type an output style again and do output
style new. It's actually an agent. I didn't know that. Let's just be simple. You are a home lab expert
designed to help me create the best home
lab possible. That's it. Now we can get a lot crazier than that,
but you get the idea and that's it. If I type in output style, there it is, I can adopt that right now or when
I back out and I jump back in. I think it should adopt that
style by default. Yes it does. You can create output styles that are
tied to just your project or as a whole, whatever project you jump into, you
can switch to those output styles. I'm using the output style
right now to make this video. You want to see it script writing, output
style and this is what it looks like. It's pretty intense. Optimize
for what I do. Now, honestly, this entire video could be about clo. There are so many features like you can
do shift tab to cycle between modes. One of my favorites is planning mode,
hit shift tab. There were plan mode on this will put a very well thought out
plan together and then you approve it and then it just does it like there
it is and no keep planning or yes, let's keep doing it. And there are
so many things I can't dive into 'em. They have prompts, hooks,
custom status lines. You can paste images into your
terminal. But here's the thing, I don't just use Claude code, I use
Gemini. I use Claude code and I use Codex, which is Chad Biz's terminal
tool all at the same time. Let me show you how Gemini,
Claude Code, Chad, BTS, codex. I'm using all three right now to work
on this video script. How two steps. First, as long as I open up Claude,
Gemini and Codex in the same directory, they're all using the same
context. It's the same project. Let's do that right now. Claude Gemini, if I spell it right and Codex, the second thing I do is I make sure
my context files are all synced up. They all say the same thing. So
Gemini, do MD, claw MD and Agents md, which is what Codex uses and they're
trying to make it a standard. They're all the same. And I usually have a terminal open for
each one while I'm working on a script or any kind of project. Watch this, I'll tell Claude to write a hook
for this video authority angle. Write it to Authority Hook md. I'll have Jim and I write a
hook on a discovery angle, write it to Discovery hook.md
and then I'll have Codex review it. And that's normally
what I do. I find chat. BTS very good at analyzing
things from a high view. Gemini and Claude are very good at the
work, the deep work and look at it go. They're all using the same
context, different roles. I mean have three different ais working
on the same thing at the same time. No copying and pasting. They
can see each other's work. They're working in the same directory.
That's awesome. And it's done. Looks like Claude won this
one. Good job, Claude. Now are you seeing what's happening here?
This is the craziest part about this. Everything I'm doing talking with
these three different ais on a project, it's not tied in a browser,
it's not tied in a gui. It's just this folder right
here on my hard drive. I can copy and paste that folder
anywhere. All the work, all the decisions, all the context. It's mine.
And that's the difference. Nothing annoys me more than when
Chad GBT tries to fence me in. Give me that vendor Lockin. So I
can't leave. No, I reject that. I own my context. If a new
greater, better AI comes out, I'm ready for it because all my
stuff is right here on my hard drive. I will use all ai, I'll use the
best ai. No one could stop me. So I got a little excited there and
that's what I want you to take away here. Leading the browser,
going to your terminal, puts you back in control and
it gives you better features. But now I want to get real practical. I want to show you exactly
how I run a project like this. How I keep things in
sync, how I keep my claw, Gemini and agent's files in sync and
work on a daily basis using a system like this. I'm going to refill my
coffee. I'll see you there. Okay. This video was made with this process. First thing I want to show you
is how things are synced up. Specifically my Claude file, my
Gemini file, and my agent's file, which is Codex. It's an
agent. That's all it is. So if I get back to my terminal here where
I was showing you earlier when we had our hooks developed, Claude made
one, made one and Codex critiqued it. I rely on Claude to run my agent.
That will close out everything. So I'll just normally do this when
I'm done for the day. I'll go, Hey, let's close this out, run and I'll mention my
agent script session closer. Lemme show you what that looks like. This is one of those agents
I keep as a personal agent. I use it for many projects and
these agents are just files. They're files inside an agent's
folder. I'll cat that file here, script session closer and here
it is. It does a lot of stuff, but some of the key things it does, and actually while I'm
talking with you about this, I'm going to go and run the agent.
We did some stuff, didn't we? I'll run the agent, but first it'll
gather everything we talked about, everything we did and do
a comprehensive summary. It'll then update a session summary file
that's specific to just updating what are some things that were
done in the past sessions. It'll see if any core project
files need to be updated. And if I'm talking with Claude,
it'll update every context. File Claude Gemini agents and then
this is probably my favorite part. I commit my project to a GitHub repo. So normally you would use Git for
code for writing and deploying code. I treat my scripts and pretty much every
project I work on in my life like code, we commit that change, give a reason for that change so I can
see a history of what I did and why I did it. Maybe something breaks, I can go
back to that change and reinstate it. That's the power of using
GitHub with all your ideas. Now this is killer for me because
I'm really bad at documentation. I'm really bad at keeping track of things, but now I have this help
me keep track of things. So when I'm really tired at the end of
the day and I've been working on a video and my mind is fried, I'm like, okay,
tell you what, I'm done. Close this out. It will look through all this stuff.
It will figure out where I'm at, end the project, end the day where I need to be and then
I can start fresh the next day and be like, Hey, where are we at? What are we
working on? They can tell me, Hey Chuck, you finished the script. It's time to
record. We made these three decisions, go for it. That's it. This is the tool I've been looking for. The syncing is probably
my favorite part. No, no, actually this thing's my
favorite part. How it roasts me. So I don't only use these AI
terminal tools to help me create. I use them to critique me and make
me better. So here are my critics. These guys are so stinking mean and
I designed them to be they're agents. I get the brutal critic.
I told 'em to be mean. So I had an issue where my AI
was being way too agreeable. I'd write something and be like, oh Chuck,
best thing you ever wrote. I'm like, ah, you're gaslighting me. Stop it.
I wanted something to be super mean. I want it to be hard to please so that
when it did tell me I did a good job, I knew it. It was good and
that's what this thing does. So actually I'm curious if my
script right now is any good. I actually have not used it yet on this,
which I normally don't do. It's bad. Let's see. I'll say use the
brutal critic to absolutely roast and verify my stuff
is good and this script, I'll just reference my script again, everything's a file local
here on my file system. I mean you can just move so quickly and
nimbly when you have a system like this and the agent's going to go, it's
going to do its thing. And again, what I love about this is while I've
been talking with this AI for a minute, right? We've been going
back and forth doing things. If I asked that session to review me, it would have a ton of bias coming into
that based on what we've been talking about. I don't want that. I want a fresh
cup of coffee credit coming in, going, here's what I know network Chuck needs
to have and I'm going to roast his current script on what he's
doing. That's what I need. Notice it was really quick
editor free stream on that. I have inside its instructions to read
some framework documents I have that describe how I create and describe what
my thing is, who my audience is. Again, I don't copy and paste. I got context
already here. You can reference that. I love this so much. It's my favorite
thing. I had to make a video about this. I wouldn't stop telling my wife
about it and she was going crazy. Whenever he talks to me, it just
goes in one ear and out the other. I tell everyone about this. I'm actually really scared about
what it's going to say. Oh no. Okay, let's see what it said, said when I fix
it, it'll be good. What did it tell me? Oh, it's an 8.2. It's not
bad. Now I forgot I did this. The brutal critic has three personalities
or three people that come in and roast it from different angles. I forgot
I did that. It's insane. Okay, I don't like this. I'm not sure
I agree with this. We'll see. It says segment five is a feature
dump nine features, zero depth, five to 8% retention drop, which
means you'll stop watching. Let's prove it wrong. Segment
five five's coming up. We're currently in segment four. Jump
there if you want to. I don't care. Tell me if it's bad. It's
actually really cool I hope, but seriously doing stuff like
this saves me hours. Now also, I want you to know this.
It's not writing for me. I'm doing the writing
because I like to keep that. I think that's important now with
ai, but I do have AI roast me, help me stay on track. I get distracted. I might make some really bad creative
decisions that aren't in line with what we're trying to do. Now, the point I want to hit home
is that I made this for me. This is my own personal
software, exactly my use case. What can you build for you that's just
for you and your niche and whatever you're trying to make happen and
this is just one tool I've made. Look at the other stuff I've done. That crazy project I showed you in the
beginning was running like seven agents. This is a custom built project just with
claw code and I'm going to use it right after I record this. It's
going to go through every file, it's going to transcribe it, read
it, and give my editors notes. They need to be able to
edit this video like, Hey Chuck repeated himself 17 times in
the fourth video and it's a disaster. Ignore that one. It
will do that. Seriously, the tools I create are so powerful for me. I wake up every day feeling like I have
superpowers. I want this for you. Now, speaking of superpowers,
let's talk about segment five. There's a tool that's
actually open source. Now you can use any model you want with
this open source alternative and it might be the best tool of all
of them. I'm still testing it. You also get grok free, which is pretty sick and a really powerful
part of this is you can log in with your cloud Pro subscription and use it
like cloud code. Let's play with it. It's called open code. We can
install it with one command. I'll have all these commands below
installing. That was quick and that's it. If I can just launch open code, just
type it in like this. That does it. Oh, let me do a source because
it edits to my bash RC file. You might have to do
this too. Source bash rc. Now let's try it. You can open and close
your terminal and do the same thing. Oh, we're here. This is open code. A
nice two E terminal user interface. Couple of things real quick. They launched this straight
into grok code Fast one. They have a deal with grok AI that allows
you to use this for free for a while, so same story. Hey, GR code's
helping us even knows like, Hey, can I help you with your
coffee project? No mask stuff. So it read the document and it
can do all the stuff. Okay, cool. I'm going to exit out. We can use
local models. This is the killer part. I don't think any other tool does this, but we have to edit a file talking
about nano and I think it's inside config Open code. Yeah, that's the directory and then I
think the file has to be open code JSON C. I'll paste this
in here. I'm going to use, let's do llama 3.2. I think that's
what have installed. We'll find out. I'll save that. Let see llama
list, see what my models are. Do I have 3.2? I'll
pull it down if I don't, and then when I launch OPA code again
with that config in place, oh wait, what did I break? Lemme fix that
file real quick. There we go. I should be able to go forward
slash model and change to LAMA 3.2. Hey, cool Lama works. If I back out, I can log into cloud with this command, open code auth login. I can choose Aaro with my cloud
pro and I'll launch this browser, paste this code in there
and now log into cloud code. I just launch open code now
and switch models to cloud sonet 4.5 and we can pick up our
wheel left off because again, all our files are local. It
doesn't matter what tool we use. It's all ours right here. I can switch
models midway. Let's go back to gro. Cool, what's our next step?
Cool. While it's doing that, I can do new session.
This is a new session. There's models to Claude.
I can do sessions, see all the sessions I have.
Why do I have so many? Oh, these are my past sessions. We can also share these sessions
slash share and watch this. This is so crazy. I think
I was going to do it. Oh, the URL is copied in my clipboard,
so I can go to my browser, paste that URL in and I can, I mean,
look at that. That's awesome. Wait, is it live? You can share your session
with people. That's pretty neat. Okay, we can do timeline. We can jump back in time and restore. I guess if we like how far we've come
in our conversation, we just go back. I want that in real life.
That's awesome. We can also, if I jump out of there
and do open code help, they've got agents. You can
start a headless server. You can attach to headless servers.
Export your session is JSO data. I mean this tool is pretty cool and the
fact that you can log in and use your cloud pro subscription, that's next level because otherwise
you're putting in an API key and you're paying per use and that's a whole
nightmare. I'd rather pay up front. What's fun is I've been following these
guys on Twitter before they started making this code, open code, this
guy Dax, these guys are killing it. So how do you feel about your browser
based gooey AI now? Pretty bad, right? Kind of feels like hammer and
chisel or chisel and hammer. I never know how to say it because
now you can control your context. Break out of that browser, that chat window and don't let
the terminal scare you. I mean, I know it's kind of intimidating if you're
not used to working in the terminal. If you can get past that,
this tool is for everyone. Everyone should be using
this. Make everyone use this. I'm going to make my kids use
this. I dunno about my wife. I'm not sure if she's
going to do it. Seriously, nothing is stopping you from trying
this right now. Jim and I see a lie. That's free open code. You can run local models if you're
worried about that and while cloud code is paid, it's overpowered, like you saw all
those features. I use that every day. Dude, just you got to try it. Dip
your toe in the water, it's fine. It's awesome. You will feel like you have a superpower
and build whatever you want. Now, do you want to go even
deeper? You can add tools, MCP servers to any of these
terminal environments. I made a video about doing MCP servers
here. You can add it to all these. Check it out. That's the video. I'll
catch you guys next time. Oh, by the way, have you hacked the
YouTube algorithm today? Let's make sure you do hit that
light button. Subscribe, comment. I gave a doc notification bell. You
got to hack YouTube today, ethically, of course. Oh, and also let me know which is your
favorite terminal AI tool or if you even care. I'm curious, do you care about
this? Because I care a lot, obviously. Tell me below. Yeah,
that's it for real. Hey, you made it to the end of the
video. This portion of the video, I like to reserve for praying
for you. You are a person. Well, actually I can't say that
anymore. It might be ai. I don't know if you're a person,
this is for you. You have a life, you've got goals, you've got
things you're trying to do. You're watching this video because
you want to learn something new. I want to pray for that. I
want to pray for your life. This may not be your thing. Totally
cool. You can click off, that's fine. So I put it at the end of the
video, but if you stay, thank you. The reason I'm doing this is because
I do believe in the power of prayer. The reason I do anything on this channel
to help people or all the things I'm doing is because of Jesus. He saved me. He's empowered me to do everything I'm
doing and I don't know what your beliefs are on that regardless, I just
want to pray for you. That's it. So let's do it real quick. God, I thank you for the person
watching this video right now. I thank you that they are excited
about tech and their lives and wanting to do something cool. Otherwise,
why would they be here? I pray that you would just fill them
with joy about the future that you remove any anxiety that you give them peace
that you would bless their families and let their families be healthy and strong
and if there's anything going on in their lives right now
that are really hard, that's just really hard to get through divorce or just any kind of sin that's
really bogging them down, Jesus, I pray deliverance over them right now
that you give them a path forward and just let them be excited
about their career. I pray you go before them and
make their path straight, God, that you would create opportunities
for them and that they would take these skills they're learning and do something
really fun and cool with them that will provide for their families and give them
a bright future. I pray this over them, God, and ultimately I pray that all of this
will lead them to maybe one day just knowing you more deeply,
knowing you better, and knowing that having a relationship
with you is the greatest gift, the greatest thing, that there's nothing greater you can
attain apart from knowing you. Jesus, I thank you for this person and I just
thank you for this community and for letting us do this cool stuff. It's
a privilege. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. Alright, thanks guys.
I'll see you in the next one.
