## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

### Daily Metrics (Check Every Morning)
- Spotify streams (goal: +100/day by Week 2)

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**DON'T:**
1. ❌ Buy fake streams/followers (instant ban)
2. ❌ Spam comment sections (looks desperate)
3. ❌ Post and disappear (must engage with comments)
4. ❌ Use same caption for every post
5. ❌ Ignore analytics (data drives decisions)
6. ❌ Give up after 3 days (momentum builds slowly)
7. ❌ Pitch to editorial playlists after release (do it before)
8. ❌ Submit to bot playlists (wastes money, risks ban)
9. ❌ Forget to respond to DMs (loses opportunities)
10. ❌ Neglect email list (most valuable long-term asset)

**DO:**
1. ✅ Post consistently (3-5x daily minimum)
2. ✅ Engage authentically with every comment
3. ✅ Test multiple content angles
4. ✅ Track what works and double down
5. ✅ Build email list from day 1
6. ✅ Show vulnerability and realness
7. ✅ Respond to ALL playlist curator feedback
8. ✅ Thank everyone who helps promote
9. ✅ Document journey for content
10. ✅ Think long-term (this is practice for next launch)
