## 🎯 REDDIT POST (r/college, r/productivity, r/studying)

**Title:** I built an AI tool suite for students - feedback welcome!

**Post:**
```
Hey everyone,

I'm a former college student who was frustrated by paying for multiple tools (Grammarly, ChatGPT, various apps) and still not having everything I needed.

So I built AI Sim - a platform with 20+ AI tools specifically designed for students:

**What's included:**
• Essay Writer & Research Assistant
• Resume Builder & Interview Prep
• Code Helper & Debugging Tool
• Study Buddy (AI tutor)
• Mental Wellness Coach
• Budget Planner & Financial Advisor
• And 14 more tools...

**Why it's different:**
• Actually designed for student workflows
• Gamification (XP, quests) to stay motivated
• Create custom courses
• One subscription instead of 5+
• Free tier available

**Pricing:**
• Free: 5 uses/day
• Starter: $9.99/mo for 50 uses/day
• Pro: $20/mo unlimited

I'm not trying to spam - genuinely want feedback from students. What would make this more useful? What am I missing?

Happy to answer questions!

EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the responses! I'm reading through everyone's feedback.
