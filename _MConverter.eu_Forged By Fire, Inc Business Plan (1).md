of contributed income we anticipate receiving over the next several years. Our goal is to maximize the impact of our programs and initiatives while ensuring that we maintain sound financial management practices. 

We anticipate that the initial three-year fundraising goals will include the following sources of funding:

1. **Individual Donations**: We anticipate receiving contributions from individuals who are passionate about our mission and the work we do within the Springfield, Massachusetts community. Based on our past fundraising efforts, we project that individual donations will account for 40% of our total annual revenue. 

2. **Corporate Sponsorships**: We will seek sponsorships from businesses and corporations that are aligned with our mission and values and can provide a significant financial contribution to our organization. Based on conversations we have initiated with potential sponsors, we expect sponsorships to account for 35% of our total annual revenue. 

3. **Grants:** We will also apply for grants from foundations and institutions that support our mission. Through partnerships with organizations committed to similar initiatives, we expect to obtain 25% of our total annual revenue from grants. 

4. **Government Contracts**: Besides individual donations, corporate sponsorships, and grants, Forged By Fire, Inc. plans to pursue government contracts as a funding source. 

By securing contracts with government agencies at the local, state, or federal levels, we aim to diversify our revenue sources and further support our mission. Based on successful negotiations and contract awards, we project that government contracts will contribute to 20% of our total annual revenue. 

To calculate the total project revenue for the first three years, we will need to determine the projected annual revenue for each income source \(individual donations, corporate sponsorships, grants, and government contracts\) and then sum the revenues over the three years. 

Let's say the projected annual revenues for each income source are as follows:

- Individual Donations: 40% of total annual revenue

- Corporate Sponsorships: 35% of total annual revenue

- Grants: 25% of total annual revenue

- Government Contracts: 20% of total annual revenue **Assuming** the total annual revenue for the first year is $100,000, we can calculate the revenue breakdown as follows:

- Individual Donations: $100,000 x 40% = $40,000

- Corporate Sponsorships: $100,000 x 35% = $35,000

- Grants: $100,000 x 25% = $25,000

- Government Contracts: $100,000 x 20% = $20,000

Total Revenue for the First Year: $40,000 \(Individual Donations\) \+ $35,000 \(Corporate Sponsorships\) \+ $25,000 \(Grants\) \+ $20,000 \(Government Contracts\) = $120,000

To calculate the total project revenue for the first three years, we would then multiply the total annual revenue by three:

Total Project Revenue \(First Three Years\) = $120,000 \(Total Annual Revenue\) x 3 years 

= $360,000

Therefore, based on the specified income sources and revenue breakdowns, the projected projected revenue for the project's first three years would be $360,000. This information will vary seeing that the business is still in the prelaunching phase of the business.
